# Lab | MS Excel Pivot Table vs Formulas

## Introduction

As you have learned in the lesson, *MS Excel Pivot Tables and Formulas* are two different approaches to data analysis and aggregation. While Pivot Tables provide a quick and intuitive way to summarize data through drag-and-drop functionality, formulas offer more precise control and can be used to replicate pivot table results with functions like SUMIF, COUNTIF, and other aggregation formulas.

In this lab, you will practice creating aggregated pivot tables and then challenge yourself to replicate those same results using Excel formulas.
